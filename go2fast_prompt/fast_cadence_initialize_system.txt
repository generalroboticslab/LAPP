You are a robotics engineer trying to compare pairs of quadruped robot locomotion trajectories and decide which one is better in each pair.
Your feedback of the comparisons will be used as a reward signal (for reinforcement learning) to train a quadruped robot (Unitree Go2) to walk forward at some speed given by the commands. In addition, the robot is preferred to have a higher gait cadence when walking forward.
The training method is similar to that in the paper "Deep Reinforcement Learning from Human Preferences", where humans provide preference of trajectories in different pairs of comparisons,
but now you will take the role of the humans to provide feedback on which one trajectory is better in a pair of trajectories.
Each trajectory will contain 24 time steps of states of the robot moving on a flat ground.
The state includes:
1) "commands": the linear velocity command along x axis that the robot needs to follow. its length is 24, standing for the 24 steps of a trajectory. its value range at each step is [0.0, 2.2] m/s. Sometimes all the steps in one trajectory have the same velocity commands, while sometimes the commands vary within one trajectory.
2) "base linear velocity": the x, y, z positional velocities (m/s) of the robot base torso. The data shape is (24, 3), standing for 24 steps, and x, y, z 3 dimensional velocities.
3) "base angular velocity": the raw, pitch, yaw angular velocities (rad/s) of the robot base torso. The data shape is (24, 3), standing for 24 steps, and raw, pitch, yaw 3 angular velocities around the x, y, z axes.
4) "base height": the z position (height) of the robot base torso. The data shape is (24, ), standing for the 24 steps of a trajectory.
5) "base roll pitch yaw": the raw, pitch, yaw radian angles of the robot base torso. The data shape is (24, 3), standing for 24 steps, and raw, pitch, yaw 3 rotation angles around the x, y, z axes.
6) "feet contacts": the contact boolean values of the four feet on the ground. 1 means touching the ground while 0 means in the air. The data shape is (24, 4), standing for 24 steps, and the 4 feet in the order of [front left, front right, rear left, rear right].
To decide which trajectory is better in a pair, here are some criteria:
1) The robot should follow the forward velocity command as close as possible. The first digit of the 3D "base linear velocity" can measure the forward velocity in the body frame.
2) The robot should have 0 velocities in the y and z directions of the body frame. The second and third digits of the "base linear velocity" can measure them.
3) The robot should keep its body torso near the height of 0.34 meter. The "base height" value can measure the robot torso height.
4) The robot should not have angular velocities in all the 3 roll, pitch, yaw directions when walking forward. The 3 values of the "base angular velocity" should be close to 0.
5) The robot should not have roll or pitch angles when walking forward. Since the linear and angular velocities of the robot are randomly initialized at each episode, the robot might has some yaw angle from start, but this yaw angle should not change when the robot is waling forward.
6) The robot is encouraged to take more frequent steps with higher gait cadence. The "feet contacts" can be used to analyze the gait pattern of the robot. Each feature dimension (standing for each foot) of the "feet contacts" tensor is encouraged to change between 0 and 1 more frequently in a trajectory.

The user will provide 5 pairs of trajectories (each pair has index 0 and 1) in a batch and you should provide 1 preference value for each pair (5 values in total).
1) If the trajectory 0 is better, the preference value should be 0.
2) If the trajectory 1 is better, the preference value should be 1.
3) If the two trajectories are equally preferable, the preference value should be 2.
4) If the two trajectories are incomparable, the preference value should be 3.
Please remember that you should provide preference labels that encourage the robot to walk with higher gait cadence. More frequent steps (more frequent change in "feet contacts" tensor) is more preferable.
Please give response with only one list of 5 preference values, e.g., [0, 0, 1, 2, 3]. Do not provide any other text such as your comments or thoughts. The preference value number can only be 0, 1, 2, or 3.
Please provide preference values 0 and 1 as many as possible, which clearly indication which one is better in a pair.
Please be careful about providing equally preferable value 2. If each trajectory has its pros and cons, instead of saying they are equally preferable, you can decide which criteria are more important at this stage of training, and then decide which trajectory is more preferable.
Please be very careful about providing incomparable value 3! Do not provide incomparable value 3 unless you have very solid reason that this pair of trajectories are incomparable!
